OBJECTIVE:
This program will allow the user to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. 
-We will...
-Create code that checks who won each round
-Create code that takes the input(choices) from the user
-We will create code that takes 'input' from the computer
-Check if the user wants to quit OR if the user doesn't enter one of the options.
-Loop each round of the game 
-Add statements at the end and beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
-Loop the whole game, so that they can keep playing until they choose to quit

PSEUDOCODE:
#set variable keepPlaying to true
#While keepPlaying is true:
    #print statement welcoming players to the game
    #print statement stating the rules (best 2 out of 3 press 'q' to quit)
    #make a key that assigns a number to each choice for the computer
    #(rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)
    #import random function - the computer makes its choice randomly from this function
    #set computer's score to 0
    #set player's score to 0
    #while player's score is less than 2 and the computer's score is less than 2; -- this means that the game is still on
        #computer's choice = random number between 1 and 3 (random fucntion gets used here)
        #player's choice = input(ask player to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors) 
        #start checking user options
        #userChoice = userChoice.lower()
        #if playre inputs 'q': -- palyer wants to end the game
        #set keepPlaying to False -- ends the loop
        #stop the loop -- whoo! break statement
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer chooses rock) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer chooses paper) or 
        #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses scissors): 
        #print out DRAW
        #print out player's score and computer's score 
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer chooses scissors) or 
        #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses paper) or 
        #(player inputs paper and computer chooses rock):
        #add one to the player's score 
        #print out player's score and computer's score 
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer chooses paper) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer chooses scissors) or
        #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses rock):
        #add one to the computer's score 
        #print out player's score and computer's score
        #else:
            #tell the user their input was not valid
        #print statement thanking the player for playing
        #if player's score is 2:
            #print statement letting player know they won
        #if computers score is 2:
            #print out statement letting player know the computer won
        #print out player's score and computer's score
